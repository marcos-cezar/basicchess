The piece is more active in the extended center where it can attack more squares than in the corner and is the only one that cannot lose time and therefore cannot avoid zugzwang positions.",
    "king_move_big_description": "The King is the most important piece of chess, whose capture is the only objective of the game. Since it cannot be exchanged during a match, it is considered a priceless piece. During a game, the King cannot remain under threat from the opposing pieces at any time, and must be put to safety immediately on the next move, if attacked. The rules of etiquette in chess indicate that by threatening the opponent's King, the attacker can break the silence of the game and announce \"Check!\" and, in case the King cannot escape capture, announce \"Checkmate! \". These gestures are considered optional under the game rules. Its movement consists of moving a square in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction, as long as it is not under enemy attack. If it has not yet been moved in the game, the King is allowed to perform a special move called castling with one of the rooks, with which it can be protected by moving it two squares horizontally, if these squares are not under attack and the King is not be in check.",
    "pawn_move_big_description": "The pawn moves vertically on the column it is in, being unable to retreat. In the first move, from the starting point, you can advance two spaces and, from there, one. A pawn can capture the piece immediately on the diagonal row. When on the fifth rank, it can capture en passant the opponent's pawn on the adjacent file that advances two squares on its first move. Upon reaching the eighth row, it becomes any other piece, excluding the king, a move called coronation or promotion; the pawn will be immediately replaced by another piece than the knight, bishop, rook or queen and must be removed from the board. It is worth noting that when being transformed it cannot be removed in a first move.",
    "ruy_lopez_opening_description": "The Ruy Lopez, also known as the Spanish Opening, quickly develops the kingside pieces and puts pressure on the center. 3... a6 This is the most popular move, but many other moves have been here played.",
    "sicilian_opening_description": "The Sicilian Defense is Black's most popular response to the \"1.e4\" move, especially among the strongest chess players. It allows Black to fight for the center, directly attacking the \"d4\" square, while avoiding the symmetrical positions that arise from \"1...e5\".\n    Because it is so popular, the Sicilian defense also has many, all of which are quite diverse. The main line starts with the answer 2...d6: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3, where Black's answer defines as main variants:\n    5...a6 : Najdorf variant\n    5...Nc6 : Classic Variant\n    5...e6 : Scheveningen variant\n    5...g6 : Dragon Variant\n    In addition to these, the Smith-Morra Gambit, the Alapin Variant, the Sveshnikov Variant, the Accelerated Dragon and the Scheveningen Variant are also common."
